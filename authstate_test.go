// TestPOP3_NoopRsetRejectedPreAuth is the regression guard for issue #11. RFC
// 1939 places NOOP and RSET in the TRANSACTION state (§5/§6), reachable only
// after a successful USER/PASS (or APOP) exchange. Issuing either command while
// the session is still in AUTHORIZATION must be answered -ERR, not +OK. Against
// the old code both commands fell straight through to their handlers and replied
// +OK before any authentication, so this test fails; the fixed dispatch gates
// them on s.auth.authenticated like every other TRANSACTION command.
