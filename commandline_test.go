// TestPOP3_CommandLineTooLongIsBounded is the regression guard for the pre-auth
// memory-DoS in issue #9. A hostile client can stream an arbitrarily large
// "command line" with no CRLF; the old reader (bufio.Reader.ReadString('\n'))
// buffered all of it without limit, waiting forever for a newline. The bounded
// reader must instead stop at a fixed cap and answer -ERR rather than growing.
//
// Against the unbounded code this test fails: the server buffers the flood, never
// finds a '\n', and never replies, so readLine hits its deadline. Against the
// bounded code the server caps the line and replies -ERR promptly.
